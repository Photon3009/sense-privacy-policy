    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Sense is a Chrome extension that provides contextual explanations for selected text using AI that runs entirely on your device. We are committed to protecting your privacy.</p>

    <h2>Data Collection</h2>
    <h3>What We Collect</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Authentication Information:</strong> When you sign in with Google, we receive your name, email address, and profile picture from Google to personalize your experience.</li>
        <li><strong>User Preferences:</strong> Your settings (such as trigger behavior preferences) are stored locally in your browser.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>What We Do NOT Collect</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The text you select on webpages</li>
        <li>Your browsing history</li>
        <li>The content of webpages you visit</li>
        <li>AI-generated explanations</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Local Processing</h2>
    <p>All AI processing happens <strong>entirely on your device</strong>. The text you select and the explanations generated are never sent to external servers. The AI model runs locally in your browser using WebGPU technology.</p>

    <h2>Data Storage</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>AI Model Files:</strong> Downloaded once and cached locally in your browser (300MB-900MB depending on selected model).</li>
        <li><strong>Lookup Cache:</strong> Recent text explanations are cached locally to improve response time. This data never leaves your device.</li>
        <li><strong>Settings:</strong> Your preferences are stored locally using Chrome's storage API.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Google Sign-In:</strong> Used for authentication. Google's privacy policy applies to the authentication process.</li>
        <li><strong>Hugging Face:</strong> AI model files are downloaded from Hugging Face's CDN. No user data is sent to Hugging Face.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>We do not sell, trade, or share your personal information with third parties. Your authentication information is used solely to identify your account within the extension.</p>

    <h2>Data Deletion</h2>
    <p>You can delete all extension data at any time by:</p>

        <li>Uninstalling the extension</li>
    </ul>
